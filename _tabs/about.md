Hey! 👋

## What I'm building
- Tinkering with Software Defined Radio (SDR) projects and a minimalistic homelab that runs my personal services (website, VPN, virtual router).
- Building FPV quadcopters—a mix of electronics, IT, and telecommunications—where I tune sensors, batteries, and other small hardware upgrades.
- Starting and iterating on hands-on projects whenever I can, even if they evolve over time.

## Background
I’m currently on a work-study contract with a logistics company, focused on systems and network work across multiple operating systems (with a soft spot for Linux). Before engineering school, I spent two years studying Networks and Telecommunications at university, which deepened my passion for electronics and telecoms.

## Outside of tech
I recharge outdoors—skiing and diving whenever I get the chance. This site is my place to share IT notes and document the tech projects I take on. Thanks for stopping by!
