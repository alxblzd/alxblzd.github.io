Hello stranger! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Alexandre Balzard, and I am currently engaged in a work-study contract with a logistics company, where I focus on systems and network tasks. I work with various operating systems, but I have a particular preference for Linux. Prior to my engineering studies, I spent two years at university studying Networks and Telecommunications, which fueled my already burning passion for electronics and telecommunications.

I love experimenting with Software Defined Radio (SDR) and also run a minimalistic homelab that hosts essential services like a website, VPN, virtual router, and VLAN for home use. My ongoing hands-on projects include building FPV quadcoptersâ€”a perfect mix of electronics, IT, and telecommunicationsâ€”where Iâ€™ve worked on various aspects related to sensors, batteries, and basic electronic improvements. I often start various projects that keep me busy, even if they donâ€™t always get finished!

When Iâ€™m not immersed in technology, I enjoy outdoor activities like skiing and diving, which help me recharge. This website serves as a platform for sharing my IT notes and showcasing the tech projects I embark on whenever I can. Thanks for visiting!
