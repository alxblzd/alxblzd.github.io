Hey! 👋

## What I'm building

I enjoy experimenting and learning by doing. My current projects include:

- Running a homelab to host services such as my website, cloud storage everything well firewalled and protected.
- At a time i was designing and flying FPV quadcopters, combining electronics, IT, and telecommunications, lot of fun !
- Launching hands-on projects whenever possible.

## Background

I currently work as a Networks and Systems Engineer in the logistics sector, focusing on infrastructure, cloud, and cybersecurity across differents environments, with a strong preference for Linux-based systems and virtualization/networks.

I hold an engineering degree with a specialization in Cybersecurity, and previously completed a university degree in Networks and Telecommunications, which laid the foundation for my interest in networking, electronics, and telecom systems. My experience spans hybrid cloud infrastructures, network security, and automation, both professionally and through personal and even academic projects.

## Outside of tech

When I'm not working on technical projects, I recharge outdoors through skiing and running and more rarely diving. This website is my personal space to share IT notes, experiments, and project documentation. Thanks for stopping by!
