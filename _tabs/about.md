Hey! 👋

## What I'm building

I enjoy experimenting and learning by doing. My current projects include:

- Running a minimal homelab to host my personal services such as my website, VPN, and a virtual router.
- Designing and flying FPV quadcopters, combining electronics, IT, and telecommunications. This involves tuning sensors, power systems, and testing small hardware optimizations.
- Launching hands-on projects whenever possible, even if they grow and evolve over time.

## Background

I currently work as a Networks and Systems Engineer in the logistics sector, focusing on infrastructure, cloud, and cybersecurity across heterogeneous environments, with a strong preference for Linux-based systems.

I hold an engineering degree with a specialization in Cybersecurity, and previously completed a university degree in Networks and Telecommunications, which laid the foundation for my interest in networking, electronics, and telecom systems. My experience spans hybrid cloud infrastructures, network security, and automation, both professionally and through personal projects.

## Outside of tech

When I'm not working on technical projects, I recharge outdoors through skiing and diving. This website is my personal space to share IT notes, experiments, and project documentation. Thanks for stopping by!
